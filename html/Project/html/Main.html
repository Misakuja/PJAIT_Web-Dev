<h1>Hello~</h1>
<h2>Welcome, kind traveller from the future. </h2>
<p>Hi! I’m Anna, a 2nd-year Computer Science student at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology (PJAIT) in
    Gdańsk, currently in my 4th semester. I'm planning to pursue a specialization in Cybersecurity, with a secondary
    focus on
    Internet of Things (IoT).</p>

<p>I’m driven by curiosity and the desire to build secure, efficient, and innovative systems that solve real-world
    problems. Whether it's hardening systems against threats or connecting devices in a smart, scalable way, I’m
    passionate about staying at the intersection of modern tech and digital safety.</p>

<h1>Academic Focus</h1>
<p>At PJAIT, I’ve gained hands-on experience with a broad spectrum of technologies while laying a strong theoretical
    foundation in computer science.</p>
<p>My academic interests are increasingly aligning with:</p>

<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Network security, ethical hacking, secure coding practices</p>

<h2>Internet of Things</h2>
<p>Embedded systems, real-time communication, smart device integration</p>

<h2>Full-stack applications</h2>
<p>Full-stack integrated apps.. idk</p>

<p>By combining Cybersecurity with IoT, I aim to tackle modern challenges around privacy, data integrity, and secure
    device communication in increasingly connected environments. I am also hopeful to continue my side passion of web development whilst at it.</p>
